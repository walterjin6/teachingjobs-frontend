  <h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 20px;">Building Resilience in Students</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">For many children, the past year brought disruption on a grand scale, with the pandemic affecting virtually every aspect of their daily lives. And while “caregivers can’t always alter children’s circumstances or shield them from discomfort, they can offer a more enduring gift: tools to manage adversity,” writes therapist and school counselor Phyllis L. Fagell for The Washington Post.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">But it’s clear that educators also play an essential role in helping children develop the determination and ability to persevere through difficult circumstances in school and life—this year, and anytime.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">When educators help students “cultivate an approach to life that views obstacles as a critical part of success, we help them develop resilience,” writes Marilyn Price-Mitchell, a developmental psychologist and author. “Resilience is not a genetic trait. It is derived from the ways that children learn to think and act when faced with obstacles large and small.” When the adults in children’s lives—caregivers, teachers, coaches—help young people develop resilience, it helps them “emerge from challenging experiences with a positive sense of themselves and their futures,” says Price-Mitchell.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">It’s a skill that takes practice. “Resilience works like a muscle we can build through effort and repetition, and we want to keep our muscles strong and flexible so we can think of many ways to solve a problem,” Mary Alvord, a psychologist and author, tells Fagell. “At the core, resilience is the belief that while you can't control everything in your life, there are many aspects you can control, including your attitude.”</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 20px;">SET BRAVE GOALS</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">A big part of developing resilience involves being able to identify personal goals, and then being able to “tolerate the discomfort that’s creating resistance toward that goal,” psychologist Ryan C.T. DeLapp tells Fagell. This year, a brave goal might involve asking students to contemplate the camera-on/camera-off dilemma, exploring how it impacts their personal and academic growth. “Is not being on camera interfering with your academics, or likely to make it harder for you to be visual socially when the pandemic ends?” asks DeLapp. “That represents an opportunity for a brave goal.”</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">Many educators use a SMART framework to help students set personal goals that are: specific; measurable; attainable; relevant; and timely. “It’s not easy to write SMART goals,” writes Maurice J. Elias, a professor in the psychology department at Rutgers University. “This skill takes time to develop, and it’s especially important to have in place for students at the secondary level.”</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">A vague goal, Elias writes, might look like this: “I will do better on my next report card.” But a more productive goal—one that’s a good mix of ambitious yet achievable—might look like this: “In the next marking period, I will take careful notes and review them at least two days before tests and quizzes so that I can ask the teacher questions about what I don’t understand. I will do my math homework before I do things with friends, and when I hand it in, I will ask the teacher about anything I am not sure about. When I get anything wrong, I will make sure to ask the teacher, or one of my classmates how they got the right answer.”</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">Once a child meets a goal, it’s especially important to celebrate the achievement, notes DeLapp. “Make time to reflect on progress toward their brave goal, and express gratitude and excitement when they meet them,” Fagell advises.</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 20px;">MODEL LEARNING FROM MISTAKES</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">Learning from failure “is paramount to becoming a resilient young person,” writes Price-Mitchell. Teachers can help by creating a classroom where “failure, setbacks, and disappointment are an expected and honored part of learning,” where students are “praised for their hard work, perseverance, and grit, not just for grades and easy successes,” and where they are held accountable for producing work about which they feel “ownership and internal reward.”</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">Consider creating a classroom bulletin board where, in addition to showcasing students’ achievements, “students can brag about their biggest mistakes and what they learned from them,” wrote educational consultant and author, Richard Curwin. “Be sure to tell the class about your own mistakes, especially if they are funny, and what you learned from them,” wrote Curwin, who died in 2018. Give students opportunities to correct mistakes and resubmit work and be sure to recognize when their work improves because “nothing shows learning from mistakes more than improvement,” Curwin noted.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">Or you can explicitly label some activities “rough-draft thinking” suggest math professor Amanda Jansen and her co-authors in a 2017 study, giving students “permission to ask questions, make mistakes, and then revise without the stifling prospect of failure.”</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 20px;">ENCOURAGE RESPONSIBLE RISKS</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">High school special education teacher Daniel Vollrath likens resilience to a stress ball. “A stress ball is resilient because it springs back to its original shape after being squeezed,” Vollrath writes. “Likewise, when students experience stress or frustration, we can think of that as pressure on them that they need to spring back from. The hope in presenting them with strategies to build resilience is that those strategies will ease the frustration and help them get back into optimal and productive focus for learning."</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">One way to foster resilience is to recognize and compliment students when they take responsible risks and challenge themselves—even and maybe especially when they don’t achieve the desired results. For example, speaking up to answer a question during a Zoom class, even if the answer is incorrect, or “stumbling on words while reading out loud,” writes Vollrath. “These are opportunities to build confidence, and risk-taking, and most importantly, to keep a resilient momentum going forward while in a safe space.”</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 20px;">LABEL DIFFICULT EMOTIONS</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">Recognizing and naming emotions, from elementary school through high school, can help students “become self-aware and begin to manage their own emotional states effectively—psychologists call this labeling,” writes Jorge Valenzuela, an education coach and adjunct professor at Old Dominion University. Once students learn to notice, name, and interpret their emotions, they are better prepared to make rational decisions and manage disorienting or disruptive emotions in their lives—critical elements of resilience.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">A good place to start in the classroom is with quick daily emotional check-ins. Valenzuela  lays the groundwork for these at the beginning of the year, using Plutchik’s Wheel of Emotions to teach students the words they can use to describe the emotions they’re feeling—with varying degrees of complexity based on grade level. “I find that [the emotion wheel] helps them categorize their emotions and their responses to those emotions,” Valenzuela writes. “Additionally, students can recognize that other emotions are an amalgamation of the eight basic emotions or are derived from one or more of them. This is a very powerful realization for them—it serves to help them identify emotional triggers and begin planning to respond with good self-management strategies.”</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 20px;">WRITE AND TALK ABOUT SETBACKS AND HUMAN RESILIENCE</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">In middle and high school, writing assignments that focus on “sources of personal strength” can help kids explore different ways to build resilience, writes Price-Mitchell, who provides a few prompts to get started: “Write about a person who supported you during a particularly stressful or traumatic time. How did they help you overcome this challenge? What did you learn about yourself?” Another idea: “Write about a time in your life when you had to cope with a difficult situation. What helped and hindered you as you overcame this challenge? What learning did you take away that will help you in the future?”</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">But the topic of resilience isn’t bound to one class—ELA, for example—it’s relevant across the curriculum. “Opportunities abound to connect resilience with personal success, achievement, and positive social change,” Price-Mitchell notes. “Expand discussions about political leaders, scientists, literary figures, innovators, and inventors beyond what they accomplished to the personal strengths they possess, and the hardships they endured and overcame to reach their goals. Help students learn to see themselves and their own strengths through these success stories.”</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Using PERMA pillars to support teachers</h2>
  <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: black;">With over 20 years of experience as a teacher, you don’t have to tell me that teachers are among those professionals with the highest levels of job stress and burnout across many countries (Stoeber &amp; Rennert, 2008).</p>
  <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: black; margin-top: 20px;">What we also know from the research is that ‘well teachers’ equal ‘well students’ (Roffey, 2012). Yet, as the demands on teachers increase; having to be involved in about 1000 interpersonal contacts every day (Holmes 2005), the quality of these contacts can either jeopardise or enhance a person’s wellbeing. In a nutshell, teachers can humiliate or humour, hurt or heal, humanise or de-humanise students in their classrooms. Not because they don’t care, but because they feel overwhelmed due to the pressure and expectations that both themselves and society place on the role.</p>
  <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: black; margin-top: 20px;">The bottom-line is that our teachers need more support and better strategies to manage the cognitive and emotional demands of the job. If teachers have evidence-based strategies to better understand and support their own wellbeing, they will be better placed to not only survive but flourish and become better role models for our students. If we truly want to help young people flourish, we must begin with our teachers.</p>
  <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: black; margin-top: 20px;">Thankfully, science is paving the way with proven strategies and tools to enhance wellbeing both individually and across organisations from the field of positive psychology. Wellbeing is a multidimensional construct that typically differentiates between hedonic wellbeing (feeling good) and eudaimonic well-being (functioning well). Positive psychology aims to merge these two forms of thought through the study of optimal human functioning and what makes life most worth living.</p>
  <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: black; margin-top: 20px;">Martin Seligman, often considered the father of positive psychology wanted to bridge the hedonic/eudaimonic divide by identifying wellbeing as a construct that was not limited to life satisfaction alone but as several contributing factors, which formed the mnemonic PERMA.</p>
  <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: black; margin-top: 20px;">Positive emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning and Accomplishment.</p>
  <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: black;">The model is often described as ‘pillars’ and involves assisting individuals to explore the five domains that encompass PERMA as a way of holding themselves up. While the model has not been designed to be prescriptive, the evidence within each pillar tells us there are simple things we can do support our own wellbeing.</p>
  <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: black; margin-top: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Perhaps you could consider these five questions:</p>
  <ul style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: black;">
  <li>-Positive emotion. When are you happiest at work? What emotion are you experiencing?</li>
  <li>-Engagement. What do you love most about your current role? What strength are you using?</li>
  <li>-Relationships. Who supports you most at work? Who do you support?</li>
  <li>-Meaning. What is most important to you about your role? Why do you do what you do?</li>
  <li>-Accomplishment.  What big or small achievements have you made in the past week-month?</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: black; margin-top: 20px;">Of course, answering these questions is not going to help you tick off things on your to-do list, nor is it going to solve systemic flaws that cause excessive admin. But what if, by reflecting on these questions every so often, you are able to shift your focus to what is working instead of what isn’t working.</p>
  <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: black; margin-top: 20px;">Perhaps that could be the moment you have a meaningful connection of conversation with a student and they remember it for the rest of their life. Perhaps these small shifts in mindset lead to more productive conversations in the staff room. Perhaps reflecting on how we support our wellbeing is the first step to shifting habits and moving towards a positive organisational culture.</p>
  <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: black; margin-top: 20px;">If you want to learn more, you must read the foundational book by Martin Seligman, <em>Flourish</em>. You can find more specific tools that map PERMA to both classroom and staff room strategies online.</p>

  <div class="blog__content">
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="">Virtual hiring for academic jobs has gained significant popularity in recent years, and there are several reasons why it is on the rise beyond just coping with a pandemic!</span></p>
<p><span style="">This shift to online platforms for academic job recruitment offers numerous benefits for both employers and job seekers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="">Let's explore some of these advantages:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style=""><strong>&gt; Access to a Larger Talent Pool:</strong> Virtual hiring enables institutions to tap into a broader talent pool beyond their geographical limitations. Traditional hiring processes often restrict the search to local or regional candidates. However, with online platforms, universities and colleges can reach out to qualified candidates from around the world, increasing the chances of finding the best fit for a position.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style=""><strong>&gt; Cost-Effectiveness:</strong> Conducting academic job searches and interviews online significantly reduces costs associated with in-person interviews. Institutions save money on travel expenses for candidates and search committee members. Moreover, virtual hiring eliminates the need for physical venues and related logistical arrangements, resulting in cost savings for the hiring institution.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="">&gt; <strong>Time Efficiency:</strong> Virtual hiring streamlines the recruitment process and reduces the time taken to fill academic positions. Coordinating schedules and arranging in-person interviews can be time-consuming, especially when multiple candidates are involved. By leveraging online platforms, institutions can conduct initial screenings, interviews, and even presentations more efficiently, enabling faster decision-making and hiring.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style=""><strong>&gt; Enhanced Diversity and Inclusion:</strong> The virtual nature of academic job searches promotes diversity and inclusion in hiring. Geographical limitations can inadvertently limit the diversity of the applicant pool in traditional hiring processes. Online platforms help overcome these barriers, allowing a more diverse range of candidates to apply for academic positions. This, in turn, promotes inclusivity and enriches the intellectual and cultural diversity within institutions.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style=""><strong>&gt; Flexibility for Candidates:</strong> Online academic job searches provide flexibility for candidates, eliminating the need to travel for preliminary interviews. This is especially beneficial for individuals who may face constraints due to personal or professional commitments. Virtual hiring allows candidates to participate in interviews from their preferred locations, making it more convenient and accessible for a wider range of applicants.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style=""><strong>&gt; Environmental Impact:</strong> With virtual hiring, there is a reduced carbon footprint associated with travel, as candidates and search committee members do not need to physically commute for interviews. This aligns with the growing focus on sustainability and environmental consciousness, making virtual hiring a more eco-friendly choice.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style=""><strong>&gt; Technological Advancements:</strong> Rapid advancements in technology have made virtual hiring easier and more seamless than ever before. Video conferencing, online collaboration tools, and applicant tracking systems have improved the efficiency and effectiveness of online recruitment processes. These technological tools enable effective communication and evaluation of candidates, enhancing the overall hiring experience.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style=""><strong>&gt; Metrics:</strong> Virtual recruiting allows for a wide range of KPIs including time to hire, cost per hire, and candidate experience. Virtual recruiting tools allow you to collect more data on candidates and their interactions with you and make it easier to analyze that data in useful ways. For example, illustrating trends from their virtual experience throughout the candidate’s journey. All this data means you can learn what’s really happening, and you can measure the impact of your choices to better influence the outcomes of future virtual career events.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style=""><strong>&gt; Scalable and Flexible:</strong> Virtual events are easier to put together than hosting in-person events. Also, you can host virtual events more frequently and for more specific pools of talent, giving you effective strategies for targeting your ideal candidates and talent niches as broadly or as narrowly as you need. One common misconception about virtual recruiting technologies is that they only work for remote positions—but this simply isn’t the case. Even when the majority of positions will be onsite, talent acquisition teams are shifting to digital tools and hybrid recruiting events to gain efficiencies of scale, deliver a quality candidate experience, and shorten time to hire.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style=""><strong>&gt; Better Candidate Experience:</strong> According to recent TalentBoard research, candidate resentment saw its largest spike in a decade. Virtual recruiting makes the recruiting process faster, more engaging, and consistent—all of which help boost the overall quality of the interview experience for job seekers and recruiters alike.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style=""><strong>&gt; Remote is Part of the New Normal:</strong> Prior to the pandemic, many employers believed that job seekers wouldn’t be comfortable interviewing online. But as we all know, technology played a huge part in maintaining some semblance of ‘normal’ life during the health crisis, from remote work and telehealth to online ordering and contactless pickup. Employers that adopted virtual recruiting early in the pandemic quickly learned that job seekers not only respond positively to this application of technology, but that virtual recruiting enabled them to reach more candidates, meet more diverse talent, and more effectively engage with job seekers throughout the recruiting process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="">Overall, the rise of virtual hiring for academic jobs offers numerous benefits, including expanded access to talent, cost savings, time efficiency, enhanced diversity, increased satisfaction and flexibility for candidates, environmental sustainability, and leveraging advanced technologies. As these advantages continue to be recognized, it is likely that virtual hiring will become increasingly common in the academic job market.</span></p>

        <div className="mb-8">
          <p className="mb-4">
            Scott Galloway is a professor and author who has written a book called <span className="italic">The Algebra of Happiness</span>, where he shares his insights and advice on how to live a fulfilling life. One of his main themes is that happiness is not a destination, but a process that involves making choices, taking actions, and finding meaning.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Academic happiness is a term that refers to the satisfaction and well-being that students and educators experience in their learning and teaching environments. Academic happiness can be influenced by many factors, such as personal goals, interests, motivation, relationships, feedback, support, challenges, and achievements.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </div>

        <p>Using Scott Galloway’s algebra of happiness, we can write about academic happiness in the following way:</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Academic happiness </strong>= (Meaning + Relationships + Skills) x (Gratitude / Expectations)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Meaning:</strong> This is the sense of purpose and value that students and educators derive from their academic work. Meaning can be found by pursuing topics that are relevant, engaging, and aligned with one’s passions and values. Meaning can also be enhanced by connecting one’s academic work to larger social issues or personal aspirations.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Relationships:</strong> This is the quality and quantity of social connections that students and educators have with their peers, mentors, teachers, and others in their academic community. Relationships can provide support, feedback, collaboration, inspiration, and belonging. Relationships can also foster positive emotions, such as joy, trust, and empathy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Skills:</strong> This is the level of competence and confidence that students and educators have in their academic abilities. Skills can be developed by setting realistic goals, seeking feedback, practicing deliberately, and overcoming challenges. Skills can also lead to mastery, autonomy, and recognition.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Gratitude:</strong> This is the appreciation and acknowledgment of the positive aspects of one’s academic life. Gratitude can be expressed by thanking others for their help, celebrating one’s achievements, and reflecting on one’s growth. Gratitude can also increase happiness by reducing stress, enhancing optimism, and improving well-being.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Expectations:</strong> This is the level of ambition and aspiration that students and educators have for their academic outcomes. Expectations can be motivating and inspiring, but they can also be unrealistic and stressful. Expectations can also affect happiness by creating a gap between what one wants and what one has.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
       
    
       
        
        <div className="mt-8">
          <p className="mb-4">
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
            According to Scott Galloway’s algebra of happiness, academic happiness can be maximized by finding meaning in one’s academic work, building strong relationships with others in one’s academic community, developing skills that match one’s interests and goals, expressing gratitude for the opportunities and achievements in one’s academic life, and adjusting expectations to be realistic and flexible.
            <p>&nbsp;</p></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>

            Some possible additional sentences are:

          <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
          <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="">&gt;This formula is not meant to be a rigid or definitive measure of academic happiness, but rather a guide or a reminder of the factors that can influence it.</span></p>
          <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="">&gt;Academic happiness is not a static or fixed state, but rather a dynamic and fluctuating process that depends on one’s choices, actions, and circumstances.</span></p>
          <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="">&gt;Academic happiness is not only beneficial for individual students and educators, but also for the quality and impact of their academic work.</span></p>

<p><span style="">These rankings are based on five main categories: teaching (30%), research (30%), citations (30%), international outlook (7.5%), and industry income (2.5%). Each category has several sub-indicators that measure different aspects of university performance. For example, teaching includes indicators such as student-to-staff ratio, doctorate-to-bachelor’s ratio, doctorates awarded-to-academic staff ratio, institutional income, and reputation survey. Research includes indicators such as research income, research productivity, research reputation survey, and research influence. Citations measure how often a university’s research is cited by other scholars around the world. International outlook includes indicators such as international-to-domestic-student ratio, international-to-domestic-staff ratio, international collaboration, and international reputation survey. Industry income measures how much a university earns from its knowledge transfer activities with industry partners.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="">While rankings can be useful to compare universities at a glance, they are not the only factor to consider when choosing a university. Rankings do not capture everything that matters to students, such as campus culture, student support services, extracurricular activities, learning environment, social life, and personal fit. Rankings also do not reflect the quality of specific programs or courses within a university. Therefore, it is important to look beyond rankings and do your own research on different universities and their offerings.</span></p>

  <div class="blog__content">
  <p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><span style="";">The evolution of university recruitment has undergone significant changes in recent years, with the increasing adoption and integration of digital platforms. Traditional methods of recruitment, such as on-campus career fairs and job postings, have been supplemented and, in some cases, replaced by innovative digital strategies. This shift has been driven by several factors, including advancements in technology, changing candidate preferences, and the need for more efficient and cost-effective recruitment processes. According to a report by McKinsey, companies can reduce their cost per hire by 60% using digital recruiting methods. The Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) estimates that recruiters can save up to 80% of their time by using AI-powered recruitment tools.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p><p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="";">&gt; One of the key drivers behind the embrace of digital platforms in university recruitment is the rise of online job boards and professional networking sites. Platforms like AcademicJobs.com, LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor have become popular destinations for both candidates and employers. These platforms offer a vast pool of talent and provide an efficient way for employers to reach out to potential candidates. Employers can post job openings, search for qualified candidates, and even engage in direct communication through messaging features.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p><p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="";">&gt; Social media platforms have also played a significant role in the evolution of university recruitment. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have become powerful tools for employers to connect with candidates and build their employer brand. Companies now leverage social media to showcase their company culture, share job openings, and engage with potential candidates. This shift has allowed for more personalized and targeted recruitment efforts.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p><p><p style="padding-left: 80px; font-weight: bold;"><span style="";"><em>&gt; Some interesting data on the impact of Social Media:</em></span></p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="";">&gt; In addition to online job boards and social media, virtual career fairs and recruitment events have gained popularity. Virtual career fairs provide a convenient and cost-effective alternative to traditional on-campus events. These events typically take place on dedicated virtual platforms where candidates can explore employer booths, chat with recruiters, and even participate in video interviews. Virtual career fairs allow employers to reach a wider audience of candidates from broader geographic locations.</span></p>

Data analytics also play a crucial role in identifying recruitment trends, evaluating the success of recruitment campaigns, and making data-driven decisions.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><span style="";">However, it's important to note that while digital platforms offer many advantages, they should not completely replace in-person interactions and on-campus engagement.

Therefore, a well-rounded recruitment strategy should incorporate both digital and traditional methods to maximize effectiveness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><span style="";">In conclusion, the evolution of university recruitment has been shaped by the embrace of digital platforms. The use of online job boards, social media, virtual career fairs, AI-powered tools, and data analytics has transformed the way employers connect with candidates and identify top talent.
